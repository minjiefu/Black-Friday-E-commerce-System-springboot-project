- Solved the high-concurrency problem by leveraging technologies such as flow filtering, static page CDN, cache warm-up, peak-load shifting, etc. 
- Improved the systemâ€™s performance and availability using tools such as Redis (Lua Scripts) to implement distributed locks for distributed system synchronization, Message Queue to deliver asynchronized tasks, and Sentinel for rate limiting and circuit-breaker.
